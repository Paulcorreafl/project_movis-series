# Project_final
## Generator of the best movies by genre
In this case we have decided to create a project to find the best movies and series by genre, the reason is that many times we want to watch a movie and we always get the same ones.

With this application we can find different movies and series in a more specific way by their genre, year of broadcast and age classification, as well as have a description, see their duration, rating by critics, even the votes by the public.
To do this we will carry out a series of steps:
Which we will explain below.
## Getting Started
1.We will extract a csv file from kaggle.

2.We have saved it in this folder:
```
$ https://github.com/Paulcorreafl/project_final/tree/main/data
```
3.We perform the EDA:

-For this we have decided to eliminate the null ones because they were projects or did not have the necessary information.

-We perform a data cleaning
```
$ https://github.com/Paulcorreafl/project_final/tree/main/notebook
```
-We create new columns based on the data we have

-We create a csv file with each new column we have cleaned and save it here:
```
$ https://github.com/Paulcorreafl/project_final/tree/main/csv_clean
```

4.We proceed to make the application, we will do this in a PowerBI.
